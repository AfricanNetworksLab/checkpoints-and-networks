## Description
These two R files support the analysis of road checkpoints in West Africa. We use K-functions to investigate whether events of political violence tend to cluster near checkpoints, or whether they are dispersed from them. We also examine how checkpoints are related to each other via the transportation network, and which checkpoints are more central than others.

In terms of data processing, these files provide an example of how to integrate R's sf library with older functionality from sp and spatstat along with how to create a spatial network from road shapefiles.
